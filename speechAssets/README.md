# Setting up

:clock3:  ~ `15 minutes`

## Set up an action in Adobe I/O Runtime

1. Login or Create an Account on [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Fork the repository used for the lab from:
    https://github.com/adobe-apiplatform/adobeio-runtime-lab-analytics

    > :bulb: Make sure the repository is public

3. ##### Configure a new webhook

   In this step you'll deploy your own code into Adobe I/O Runtime so that you can respond to Alexa voice commands and extract data from Adobe Analytics in response.

   Visit your new repo and go to `Settings` > `Webhooks` > `Add webhook`
   ![Github webhooks view](./readmeAssets/github-webhooks-view.png)

   Configure the new webhook with the following information:

Field        |    Value
------------ | -------------
Payload URL  | `https://runtime-preview.adobe.io/github/webhook`
Content type | _application/json_
Secret       | _( provided during the lab )_
Which events would you like to trigger this webhook? | _Just the push event._

   When done, click the `Add webhook` button. Once the webhook is saved, you should see it listed.

4. ##### Retrieve the URL for your action.
    Click the `Edit` button to go back into the webhook edit screen in order to get the URL to your action.

  Scroll down to see the `Recent deliveries` and click on the `...` button or the UID to open the details.

  <img src="./readmeAssets/github-recent-delivery.png?raw=true" height="80">

  The `Response` Tab should indicate a `200` Response with a Body containing the  `action_endpoint`.

  > :bulb: Save the value of the `action_endpoint` field as you need it in the next step.

:boom: Congratulations ! At this point your code is deployed in the Adobe I/O Runtime. Let's go ahead and invoke this action with Amazon Alexa.


## Setup an Amazon Alexa SkillÂ 

1. Login to Amazon Developer Portal at https://developer.amazon.com/

   > :bulb: The lab should have provided you with access credentials.

2. Select the `Alexa` tab and then click on `Get Started` in Alexa Skill Kit box.

  <img src="./readmeAssets/amazon-alexa-selection.png" height="220">

3. Your Amazon developer account provided for the lab is most likely setup with the `Adobe Analytics Skill` under `You skills` tab.  In this case you can fast forward to step #6 or read below for on overview on how to configure a new skill.

4. ##### Setup general skill info
  * The `Name` field should contain something unique.
  * `Invocation name` is what Alexa uses to start the Skill; for example if the invocation name is `Adobe Analytics` you should say _Use Adobe Analytics_ to activate the skill.
  * The global fields can be left with the default value

  <img src="./readmeAssets/skills_info.png?raw=true" height="360">

5. ##### Setup an interaction model
   * Paste in the intent schema from [IntentSchema.json](./IntentSchema.json)

    <img src="./readmeAssets/interaction_model.png?raw=true" height="470">

  * Create a custom slot for each of the items in [./customSlotTypes](./customSlotTypes) folder.
      * Click `Add Slot Type` and enter a `Type` and the associated `Values` similar to the screenshot bellow with `LIST_OF_DURATIONS` Type.
      * Then add another slot type called `LIST_OF_METRICS` from [./customSlotTypes](./customSlotTypes).

      <img src="./readmeAssets/amazon-alexa-custom-slot-type-edit.png" height="300" >

  * In `Sample utterances` text area paste the sample utterances from [SampleUtterances.txt](./SampleUtterances.txt) file.

    > Optionally if you want to learn more about Alexa's interaction model see https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-interaction-model-reference

6. ##### Link the Alexa skill with your GitHub code deployed in the Adobe I/O Runtime
   Click the `Configuration` option on the left side menu to see something similar to the screenshot below:

    * ##### Service Endpoint
      Select the `HTTPS` option for `Service Endpoint Type`.

      Paste the value you saved after setting up the GitHub webhook. The value should the a URL like:
      ```
      https://runtime-preview.adobe.io/github.com/<...>
      ```

      > :bulb: Alexa will invoke this URL on each interaction with an end-user.

      <img src="./readmeAssets/amazon-alexa-setup-endpoint.png" height="250" >

7. ##### :id: Allow users to authenticate with their Adobe ID
    This step connects an Alexa user with a user in Adobe's Marketing Cloud. This Adobe ID will be used to extract data from Adobe Analytics. For this the skill needs to be instructed how to authenticate users.

    Answer `Yes` to the question `Do you want to allow users to create an account or link to an existing account with you`

    * Set the Authorization URL to:
      ```
      https://ims-na1.adobelogin.com/ims/authorize/v1
      ```

    * Set the Client ID to the value provided during the lab.

    * Add the following domains to the list
      ```
      ims-na1.adobelogin.com

      adobeid-na1.services.adobe.com
      ```

    * In the scopes field add:
      ```
      openid,AdobeID,read_organizations,additional_info.projectedProductContext,additional_info.job_function,session
      ```
      These scopes are needed to pull data out from Marketing Cloud, Adobe Analytics.

    * Set Authorization Grant type to
    * Click `Next`

    <img src="./readmeAssets/amazon-alexa-link-account.png" height="420" >

* #####  Configure an SSL Certificate
  Once you see the SSL Configuration screen select the second option `My development endpoint is a sub-domain of a domain that has a wildcard certificate` .

  Click  `Next`.

:clap: You are now ready to use this skill. In the next chapter you will learn how to test it and enhance it.

# Send the first voice command to your skill

:clock3:  ~ `15 minutes`

You're almost ready to make the first voice command. At this stage you're acting as any end user that is installing the skill. You'll be going through the same experience.

### Decide how you want to interact with Alexa

There are several ways to interact with Alexa:

1. ##### Using the Browser
  * Using the `Test` tab on the page you set up the Amazon Alexa Skill.

2. ##### Using a Mobile app
    * iOS  - Install [Reverb for Amazon Alexa](https://itunes.apple.com/bt/app/reverb.ai/id1144695621?mt=8)
    * Android - Install [Reverb for Amazon Alexa](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=agency.rain.android.alexa&hl=en)

    > Once you open the mobile app use the access credentials provided during the lab to login.

3. ##### Using an Amazon Alexa device
    This is out of scope for this lab.

### Enable the skill

Open the browser to: https://alexa.amazon.com .
> Use the same credentials used to setup the Amazon Alexa skill.

On the left side menu click on `Skills`, then click `Your skills` link on top of the page. You should see a list with your skills. Click on `Adobe Analytics skill` to open it.

## Link Amazon Alexa with Adobe

The first thing end users should see after installing this skill is a screen telling them that Account Linking is required.

![Amazon Alexa Link Account](./readmeAssets/amazon-alexa-skill-link-account.png)

Click on `Enable` button and login using an Adobe ID.The browser should redirect you now to Adobe's login page.
> You should use the Adobe ID provided during the lab.

<img src="./readmeAssets/adobe-login-screen.png" height="250">

Once login is successful with Adobe, Alexa should confirm it with a message similar to the one in the screenshot below.
