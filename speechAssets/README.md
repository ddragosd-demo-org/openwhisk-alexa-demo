# Setting up

:clock3: `15 minutes`

## Set up an action in Adobe I/O Runtime

1. Login or Create an Account on [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Fork the repository used for the lab from:
    https://github.com/adobe-apiplatform/adobeio-runtime-lab-analytics
    
    > :bulb: Make sure the repository is public
    
3. ##### Configure a new webhook
   Visit your new repo and go to `Settings` > `Webhooks` > `Add webhook`

   Configure the new webhook with the following information:

   Field | Value
   ------------ | -------------
   Payload URL | `https://runtime-preview.adobe.io/github/webhook`
   Content type | _application/json_
   Secret | _( provided during the lab )_
   Which events would you like to trigger this webhook? | _Just the push event._

   ![Github webhook setup](./readmeAssets/github-webhook-setup.png)

   When done click the `Add webhook` button.

   ![Github webhooks view](./readmeAssets/github-webhooks-view.png)

   Once the webhook is saved you should see it listed.


4. ##### Retrieve the URL for your action.
    Click the `Edit` button to go back into the webhook edit screen in order to get the URL to your action.
  Scroll down to see the `Recent deliveries`.
  ![Github recent delivery](./readmeAssets/github-recent-delivery.png) and click on the `...` button or the UID to open the details.
  ![Github recent delivery expanded](./readmeAssets/github-recent-delivery-open.png)
  The `Response` Tab should indicate a `200` Response with a Body containing the  `action_endpoint`.

:boom: Congratulations ! At this point your code is deployed in the Adobe I/O Runtime. Let's go ahead and invoke this action with Amazon Alexa.

> :bulb: Make a note of the `action_endpoint` value as you need it in the next step.


## Setup an Amazon Alexa SkillÂ 

1. Login to Amazon Developer Portal at https://developer.amazon.com/

   > The lab should have provided you with access credentials.

2. Select the `Alexa` tab and then click on `Get Started` in Alexa Skill Kit box.
    ![Alexa-selection-ui](./readmeAssets/amazon-alexa-selection.png/)

3. Your Amazon developer account provided for the lab is most likely setup with the `Adobe Analytics Skill` under `You skills` tab.  In this case you can fast forward to step #6 or read below how to configure a new skill.

4. ##### Setup general skill info
  ![Skills Info](./readmeAssets/skills_info.png?raw=true )
    * The `Name` field should contain something unique.
    * `Invocation name` is what Alexa uses to start the Skill; for example if the skill is named `Adobe Analytics` you would say _Use Adobe Analytics_ to activate the skill.
    * The global fields can be left with the default value

5. ##### Setup an interaction model
    ![Interaction Model Setup](./readmeAssets/interaction_model.png?raw=true )

    * Paste in the intent schema from [IntentSchema.json](./IntentSchema.json)

    * Create a custom slot for each of the items in [./customSlotTypes](./customSlotTypes). Click `Add Slot Type` and enter a `Type` and the associated `Values` similar to the screenshot bellow:
    ![Edit Slot Type](./readmeAssets/amazon-alexa-custom-slot-type-edit.png)

    * Paste in sample utterances from [SampleUtterances.txt](./SampleUtterances.txt) inside the `Sample utterances` text area.

    > To learn more about Alexa's interaction model see https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-interaction-model-reference

6. ##### Link the Alexa skill with your GitHub code deployed in the Adobe I/O Runtime
   Click the `Configuration` option on the left side menu to see something similar to the screenshot below:
    ![Configuration](./readmeAssets/amazon-alexa-setup-endpoint.png )

    * ##### Service Endpoint

      Paste here the value you got after setting up the GitHub webhook to [ Retrieve the URL for your action](#Retrieve-the-URL-for-your-action)
      ```
      https://runtime-preview.adobe.io/<...>
      ```

      > Alexa will invoke this URL on each interaction with an end-user.

7. ##### :id: Allow users to authenticate with their Adobe ID
    This step connects an Alexa user with a user in Adobe's Marketing Cloud. This Adobe ID will be used to extract data from Adobe Analytics. For this the skill needs to be instructed how to authenticate users.

    ![Alexa-setup-account-linking](./readmeAssets/amazon-alexa-link-account.png)

    * Set the Authorization URL to:
      ```
      https://ims-na1.adobelogin.com/ims/authorize/v1
      ```

    * Set the Client ID to the value provided during the lab.

    * Add the following domains to the list
      ```
      ims-na1.adobelogin.com

      adobeid-na1.services.adobe.com
      ```

    * In the scopes field add:
      ```
      openid,AdobeID,read_organizations,additional_info.projectedProductContext,additional_info.job_function,session
      ```
      These scopes are needed to pull data out from Marketing Cloud, Adobe Analytics.

    * Set Authorization Grant type to Implicit

:clap: You are now ready to use this skill. In the next chapter you will learn how to test it and enhance it.

# Send the first voice command to your skill

You're almost ready to make the first voice command. At this stage you're acting as any end users that would install the skill and use it. To test your skill you'll be following their experience.

Open the browser to: https://alexa.amazon.com .
> Use the same credentials used to setup the Amazon Alexa skill.

On the left side menu click on `Skills`, then click `Your skills` link on top of the page. You should see a list with your skills:

![Amazon Alexa Your Skills](./readmeAssets/amazon-alexa-your-skills.png)

Click on `Adobe Analytics skill` to open it.


## Link Amazon Alexa with Adobe

The first thing end users should see after installing this skill is a screen telling them that Account Linking is required.

![Amazon Alexa Link Account](./readmeAssets/amazon-alexa-skill-link-account.png)

Click on `Enable` button and login using an Adobe ID.The browser should redirect you now to Adobe's login page.
> You should use the Adobe ID provided during the lab.

![Adobe login page](./readmeAssets/adobe-login-screen.png)

Once you login Alexa should confirm that the accounts is now linked with your skill.
