In this exercise we will configure Alexa to Respond back with "Hello" followed by your name after the skill is launched. 

1. Add code to handle new sessions requests. A LaunchRequest is an object that represents that a user made a request to an Alexa skill, but did not provide a specific intent.

// Create default handlers
var newSessionHandlers = {
    'LaunchRequest': function () {
        //Skill was launched

        //TODO: Say Hello!
        this.emit(':tell', "Hello Dylan");
    }
};

2. In the main function register the newSessionHandlers with the Alexa SDK 

alexaSDK.registerHandlers(newSessionHandlers);
